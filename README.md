# PortfolioProject
Building my data analyst portfolio bit by bit on the road to being a Data Scientist.

This is my first portfolio project using SQL. I want to thank @AlexTheAnalyst for making this possible.
He guided me through every step and I can say I am strong enough to work on a project on my own.
I used a live data set from the WHO website. All values here are real and not made up.
It is not up to date but everything I have done with it can be applied to an updated dataset.
Thanks for reading to the end.
